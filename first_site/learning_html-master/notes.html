<h1> A bit about the internet </h1>

<h1> URL </h1>

<p> URL stands for <em> Uniform Resource Locator. </em> It contains serveral different parts, including:

<li> The <strong>protocol</strong>: e.g. http, https, ftp </li>
<li> The <strong> host </strong> : e.g.<a href="www.facebook.com">www.facebook.com</a>,<a href="www.bbc.co.uk">www.bbc.co.uk</a>
<li> The <strong> path </strong>: e.g. /news/local, /john.smith.95 </li>

<h1> DNS </h1>

<p> DNS stands for Domain Name System. You buy a domain name from a registrar (e.g. <a href="123-reg">123-reg</a>, <a href="GoDaddy"<a>GoDaddy</a>). They arrange for your server's IP address to be added next to the domain name on a DNS server, so that people can find your site. This process can take a couple of days to spread out over the entire internet, as DNS servers take time to update one another using a 'gossiping' mechanism.</p>

<h1> Server-side vs. Client-side technologies </h1>

<h3> Client-side </h3>

<p> Client-side technologies run in your web browser (e.g Firefox, Google Chrome or Internet Explorer). The three main client-side technologies are:</p>

<ol> 1. HTML </ol>
<ol> 2. CSS </ol>
<ol> 3. Javascript </ol>

<h3> Server-side </h3>

<p> Server-side technologies run on the server. There are many more possibilities here. </p>
